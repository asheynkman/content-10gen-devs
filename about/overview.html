          <li>What do I need to take this class?
            <p>You will need access to a computer. A recent Windows, Mac OS or Linux based machine will work fine. </p>

          </li>
          <li>Do I need to be available during a certain hour of the day to watch the course?
          <p> The course is self-paced with weekly deadlines. The course will be broken down into short video segments with periodic assessments to check on your progress, weekly assignments and a final exam.</p></li>
          <li>How does the grading work?
          <p>You will receive your percentile rank in the course among the people who complete the course but that rank won't be on your certificate of completion. To receive a certificate of completion, you will need to achieve 65% on graded material.
          There are three different types of assessments within the course: quizzes, weekly assignments and a final exam/project. Quizzes don't count toward your grade. Quizzes are intended to help you check your own understanding. The weekly assignments will compromise one half of your grade and the final exam/project one half of your grade.
          Most assignments will be due on Mondays. Each week we will release new video lectures and a new assignments.
          We have not yet finalized a policy on late assignments.</p>
          <li> Will I be able to get help?
          <p> We will be providing online forums where students can help each other. In addition, the instructor and other 10gen employees will monitor the forums and try to help. Often the fastest answer comes from another student.  We will also be holding weekly office hours online. The technology for that is TBD.</p>
