    <p>You will receive your percentile rank in the course among the people who complete the course but that rank won't be on your certificate of completion. To receive a certificate of completion, you will need to achieve 65% on graded material. There are three different types of assessments within the course: quizzes, weekly assignments and a final exam/project. Quizzes don't count toward your grade. Quizzes are intended to help you check your own understanding. The weekly assignments will comprise one half of your grade and the final exam/project one half of your grade. Most assignments will be due on Mondays. Each week we will release new video lectures and a new assignments. We will be dropping the lowest week's homework. Late assignments are not accepted.</p>
