  Recent Quiz/Homework Data Loss
  </section>
  <section>
  <p>We are aware of widespread reports of the site losing homework and quiz progress and have deployed a solution that will likely prevent any problems in the future.  Minor data loss may have occurred around 6PM EST during the server restart.</p>
  <p>We would like to thank the community for helping to identify these problems so that we could make corrections in the first week.</p>

  M101 is launched!
  </section>
  <p>Welcome to the class.  It was a little rough getting launched but we believe the first week is now online! The first homework is due on Monday, October 29th at 11:00pm EDT.</p>
  <p>We know the course progress tab is not correct. Please ignore it for now. We will get it working in the coming days.</p>
