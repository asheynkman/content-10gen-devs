    <p>Welcome to the class.  We are launched.  It was a little rough getting launched but we believe the first week is now online! The first homework is due on Monday, October 29th at 11:00pm EDT.</p>
    <p>We know the course progress tab is not correct. Please ignore it for now. We will get it working in the coming days.</p>
