  Current Issues and Work in Progress
  </section>
  <p>We have been working on preventing any score resets in the future.  The problem has been identified and a fix has been deployed.  Scores prior to the fix have been successfully migrated and are visible on the progress page, but user input is not yet visible when viewing homework problems.</p>
  <p>Though one's answers for problems submitted before Saturday are not visible in on the page, they are still stored in the database.  The modifications needed to make these answers visible again are being tested and will be deployed today during maintenance.</p>
    <p>Other updates include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Deadline for Week 1 will be extended by 24 hours to Tue 23:00 EST.</li>
    <li>The graph on the Progress tab shows 0%, this is a bug which will be fixed.</li>
    <li>The footer on the Discussion tab can become detached upon refresh.  Until a fix is deployed, this can be remedied by clicking the Discussion tab.</li>
    <li>Hurricane Sandy may cause disruption of service today.</li>
